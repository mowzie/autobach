# AutoBach

**This project is still heavily under development and may not work out of the box for users.**

AutoBach is a project inspired by the renowned organist Johann Sebastian Bach. It is designed to control a digital organ, providing an automated way to play MIDI files in the case of no available organist. Designed specifically for a liturgical setting, it also allows for additional separator text to break up different sections, as well as additional liturgy settings and Psalm Note playback (just the intro as the notes are used across many Psalms).

## Features

**MIDI File Library:** AutoBach allows you to load MIDI files stored in the program's directory into a library. This library serves as your personal collection of hymns, ready to be played at any time.

**Playlist Creation:** From the library, you can select your favorite hymns and store them into a playlist. This playlist can be customized to your liking, allowing you to arrange your hymns in the order you prefer.

**Digital Organ Control:** AutoBach enables you to play your selected hymns through a digital organ. It provides control over all available stops, giving you the freedom to adjust the sound to your preference. **Currently, only a Rodgers 385 is supported.**

## Usage

To use AutoBach, simply load your MIDI files into the program's *Hymn* directory. The program will automatically add these files to your library the next time it loads. From there, you can select which hymns to add to your playlist and control the digital organ to play your hymns.
